S3 Module Design and Implementation

Architecture Overview
Our S3 module implements enterprise-grade object storage with comprehensive security, encryption, and access controls. The design follows AWS Well-Architected Framework principles.

Core Components

1. KMS Encryption Implementation
hcl
resource "aws_kms_key" "s3_encryption_key"
resource "aws_kms_alias" "s3_encryption_key_alias"


Design Decision: Custom KMS Key vs AWS Managed
- Chosen: Custom KMS key with alias
- Reasoning: 
  Full control over key rotation policies
  Ability to grant cross-account access if needed
  Better audit trail and key management
  Cost-effective for enterprise use (single key for multiple buckets)

Security Benefits:
- Server-side encryption at rest (AES-256)
- Key rotation capabilities
- Fine-grained access control through key policies
- Compliance with data protection regulations

 2. S3 Bucket Configuration
hcl
resource "aws_s3_bucket" "main_bucket"
resource "aws_s3_bucket_versioning" "main_bucket_versioning"
resource "aws_s3_bucket_server_side_encryption_configuration" "main_bucket_encryption"


Design Decision: Separate Resource Blocks vs Inline Configuration
- Chosen: Separate resource blocks for each configuration aspect
- Reasoning:
   AWS Provider v4+ best practices (deprecated inline bucket configurations)
   Better resource lifecycle management
   Cleaner separation of concerns
   Easier troubleshooting and updates

Feature Implementation:
- Versioning: Enabled by default for data protection
- Encryption: KMS encryption with bucket key optimization
- Tagging: Consistent tagging strategy across all resources

 3. Public Access Controls
hcl
resource "aws_s3_bucket_public_access_block" "main_bucket_pab"


Design Decision: Block All Public Access
- Chosen: All public access blocked by default
- Reasoning:
   Zero-trust security model
   Prevents accidental public exposure
   Compliance with enterprise security policies
   Can be selectively overridden if needed

 4. Bucket Policy Implementation
hcl
resource "aws_s3_bucket_policy" "main_bucket_policy"


Design Decision: Conditional Policy Application
- Chosen: Count-based conditional resource creation
- Reasoning:
   Flexible deployment across different environments
   Allows bucket creation without immediate policy requirements
   Supports gradual security hardening approach

Policy Features:
- Root account full access (account recovery scenarios)
- Specific IAM role access (principle of least privilege)
- Resource-level permissions (bucket and object-level control)

 S3 Module Variables and Flexibility

 Required Variables
- bucket_name: Unique bucket identifier
- environment: Deployment environment (dev/staging/prod)
- project_name: Project identification for tagging

 Optional Variables with Defaults
- enable_versioning: true (data protection by default)
- kms_deletion_window: 30 days (recovery window for accidental key deletion)
- block_public_acls: true (security first approach)
- enable_bucket_policy: false (flexible policy application)

 Changes Made to S3 Module During Implementation

 1. Bucket Uniqueness Fix
Problem: S3 bucket names must be globally unique
Original: Hardcoded bucket name causing conflicts
Solution: Implemented random suffix generation
hcl
 In main.tf
resource "random_id" "bucket_suffix" {
  byte_length = 4
}

 Module call
bucket_name = "${var.project}-${var.environment}-storage-bucket-${random_id.bucket_suffix.hex}"


 2. Variable Integration
Problem: Hardcoded values preventing module reusability
Original: Static values in resource definitions
Solution: Comprehensive variable implementation
- Added all configurable parameters as variables
- Provided sensible defaults for optional parameters
- Maintained flexibility for different deployment scenarios

 3. Security Hardening
Problem: Basic S3 configuration without enterprise security
Original: Simple bucket creation
Solution: Comprehensive security implementation
- KMS encryption with custom keys
- Public access blocking
- Detailed bucket policies
- Compliance-ready configuration

   Simplifies DNS and certificate management
   Allows future implementation of path-based routing
   Ready for HTTPS upgrade with certificate integration

 ALB Security Integration

 1. Security Group Configuration
The ALB integrates with our security group module for network-level protection:
- Inbound: HTTP (80) and HTTPS (443) from internet (0.0.0.0/0)
- Outbound: Communication with target groups in private subnets
- Integration: References VPC security groups for consistent policies

 2. Subnet Placement
Design Decision: Public Subnet Deployment

   NAT gateway integration for outbound traffic

 Changes Made to ALB Module During Implementation

 1. Target Group Health Check Optimization
Problem: Default health check settings too aggressive
Original: 5-second intervals with strict thresholds
Solution: Balanced health check configuration
hcl
health_check {
  enabled             = true
  healthy_threshold   = 2
  unhealthy_threshold = 2
  timeout             = 5
  interval            = 30
  path                = var.health_check_path
  matcher             = "200"
}


 2. Multi-Tier Target Group Support
Problem: Single target group limiting architecture flexibility
Original: Basic single target group setup
Solution: Comprehensive multi-tier support
- Web tier target group for front-end instances
- Application tier target group for backend services
- Independent health monitoring and scaling
- Flexible routing configuration

 3. Variable-Driven Configuration
Problem: Hardcoded values preventing environment-specific deployment
Original: Static configuration values
Solution: Comprehensive variable implementation
- Configurable health check paths
- Environment-specific naming
- Flexible subnet and security group references
- Customizable load balancer settings

 Before: Hardcoded region mismatch
provider "aws" {
  region = "us-east-1"   Different from terraform.tfvars
}

 After: Variable-driven consistency
provider "aws" {
  region = var.aws_region
}


 2. Security Group Port Range Validation
Problem: Invalid port range specification
hcl
 Before: Invalid port range
