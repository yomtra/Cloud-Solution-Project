# Cloud Solution Project

A comprehensive multi-tier AWS infrastructure deployment using Terraform, implementing enterprise-grade security, scalability, and monitoring capabilities.

## Project Overview

This project demonstrates the design and implementation of a production-ready cloud infrastructure on AWS, featuring a three-tier architecture with automated scaling, load balancing, and comprehensive monitoring. The infrastructure supports web applications with separate tiers for presentation, application logic, and data persistence.

## Architecture

### High-Level Design

The infrastructure implements a traditional three-tier architecture:

- **Web Tier**: Internet-facing components handling user requests
- **Application Tier**: Business logic processing in private subnets  
- **Database Tier**: Data persistence layer with enhanced security

### Network Architecture

- **VPC**: 10.0.0.0/16 CIDR block across two availability zones (us-west-1a, us-west-1b)
- **Public Subnets**: Web tier subnets (10.0.1.0/24, 10.0.2.0/24) with internet gateway access
- **Private Subnets**: Application tier (10.0.3.0/24, 10.0.4.0/24) and database tier (10.0.5.0/24, 10.0.6.0/24)
- **NAT Gateway**: Enables outbound internet access for private subnets
- **Network ACLs**: Tier-specific network access control lists for additional security

## Infrastructure Components

### Compute Resources

**Auto Scaling Groups**
- Web tier ASG: 1-3 instances across public subnets
- Application tier ASG: 1-3 instances across private subnets
- Instance type: t2.micro
- AMI: ami-061ad72bc140532fd
- CPU-based scaling policies with CloudWatch integration

**Application Load Balancer**
- Internet-facing ALB distributing traffic across web tier instances
- Target groups for both web and application tiers
- Path-based routing for microservices architecture support
- Health checks configured for both tiers

### Storage Solutions

**Amazon S3**

### Security Implementation

**Identity and Access Management**
- 6 IAM users across three functional groups (SysAdmin, DBAdmin, Monitor)
- Custom IAM roles for EC2 instances with SSM and S3 access
- Instance profiles for secure service-to-service communication
- Strict password policy enforcement

**Network Security**
- Security groups implementing least privilege access
- Web tier: HTTP/HTTPS access from internet, outbound to application tier
- Application tier: Inbound from web tier, outbound to database tier
- Database tier: MySQL access restricted to application tier subnets
- Network ACLs providing additional subnet-level filtering

### Monitoring and Alerting

**CloudWatch Integration**
- CPU utilization monitoring for auto scaling triggers
- Network traffic monitoring for performance optimization

## Module Structure

The project is organized into modular components for maintainability and reusability:

```
modules/
├── vpc/           # Virtual Private Cloud and networking
├── iam/           # Identity and Access Management
├── s3/            # Object storage and encryption
├── alb/           # Application Load Balancer
├── auto_scaling/  # Auto Scaling Groups and Launch Templates
├── rds_module/    # Relational Database Service
└── cloudwatch/    # Monitoring and alerting
```

Each module contains:
- `main.tf`: Primary resource definitions
- `variables.tf`: Input parameter definitions
- `outputs.tf`: Resource references for inter-module communication
- `README.md`: Module-specific documentation

## Deployment Process

### Prerequisites

- AWS CLI configured with appropriate credentials
- Terraform >= 1.0 installed
- Required AWS permissions for resource creation

### Configuration

The deployment is controlled through `terraform.tfvars`:

```hcl
# Project Configuration
project     = "cloud-solution"
environment = "dev"
aws_region  = "us-west-1"

# Network Configuration
vpc_cidr         = "10.0.0.0/16"
web_subnet_cidrs = ["10.0.1.0/24", "10.0.2.0/24"]
app_subnet_cidrs = ["10.0.3.0/24", "10.0.4.0/24"]
db_subnet_cidrs  = ["10.0.5.0/24", "10.0.6.0/24"]

# Database Configuration
name              = "myapp-database"
instance_class    = "db.t3.micro"
engine            = "mysql"
engine_version    = "8.0"
allocated_storage = 20
```

### Deployment Commands

```bash
# Initialize Terraform
terraform init

# Review planned changes
terraform plan

# Deploy infrastructure
terraform apply -auto-approve

# Remove infrastructure
terraform destroy -auto-approve
```

## Technical Challenges and Solutions

### Provider Region Inconsistency

**Issue**: Configuration files contained mismatched AWS regions between provider.tf (us-east-1) and terraform.tfvars (us-west-1).

**Solution**: Standardized on us-west-1 region and modified provider configuration to use variable reference instead of hardcoded values.

**Implementation**: Updated provider.tf to use `var.aws_region` and ensured consistent region specification across all modules.

### Security Group Port Range Validation

**Issue**: AWS rejected security group rules with invalid port range specification (-1) for TCP protocol.

**Solution**: Corrected TCP port ranges to use valid range (0-65535) for comprehensive traffic allowance.

**Impact**: Enabled proper inter-tier communication while maintaining security boundaries.

### CloudWatch Resource Naming Conventions

**Issue**: Terraform resource names beginning with underscores and numbers (_400_error_alarm) violated naming requirements.

**Solution**: Renamed resources to follow Terraform naming conventions (alb_400_error_alarm).

**Result**: Eliminated deployment failures related to invalid resource identifiers.

### S3 Bucket Global Uniqueness

**Issue**: S3 bucket creation failed due to globally unique naming requirements.

**Solution**: Implemented random suffix generation using Terraform's random provider to ensure unique bucket names.

**Implementation**: Added random_id resource and incorporated hex output into bucket naming convention.

### RDS Read Replica Configuration

**Issue**: Read replica creation required automated backups enabled on primary database instance.

**Solution**: Configured backup retention period and backup window for primary database, temporarily disabled read replica until backup activation.

**Future Enhancement**: Read replica can be re-enabled after primary database backup configuration is active.

### Module Integration and Variable Passing

**Issue**: Hardcoded subnet IDs and resource references prevented proper module integration.

**Solution**: Implemented dynamic variable passing between modules using output references.

**Examples**:
- VPC module outputs referenced by ALB and Auto Scaling modules
- Security group IDs passed between network and compute components
- Database subnet groups created using VPC subnet outputs

### Terraform State Management

**Issue**: Resource naming changes created state inconsistencies requiring manual intervention.

**Solution**: Used terraform state commands to remove outdated resource references and allow recreation with correct names.

**Process**: `terraform state rm` followed by `terraform apply` to recreate resources with updated configurations.

## Testing and Validation

### Infrastructure Validation

The deployment was validated through comprehensive testing:

- **Network Connectivity**: Verified inter-tier communication through security group rules
- **Auto Scaling**: Confirmed scaling policies respond to CPU utilization changes  
- **Load Balancing**: Validated traffic distribution across target instances
- **Database Access**: Tested application tier connectivity to RDS instance
- **Monitoring**: Confirmed CloudWatch alarms trigger appropriately
- **Security**: Verified IAM permissions and network access controls

### Destruction Testing

Complete infrastructure destruction was performed to validate:
- Clean resource removal (103 resources destroyed)
- No orphaned resources remaining
- Proper dependency handling during deletion
- State file accuracy

## Best Practices Implemented
